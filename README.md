# OmniAuth 9Flats

This is an OmniAuth 1.0 strategy for authenticating to 9Flats. To
use it, you'll need to sign up for an OAuth2 Application ID and Secret
on the [9Flats Application's Registration Page](https://www.9flats.com/us/client_applications).

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-nineflats'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::9Flats` is simply a Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth 1.0 docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :nineflats, ENV['NINEFLATS_KEY'], ENV['NINEFLATS_SECRET']
end
```

## Supported Rubies

OmniAuth Roomorama is tested under 1.8.7, 1.9.2, 1.9.3, 2.0.0, Ruby-head, Ruby Enterprise Edition, JRuby (1.8 and 1.9 mode) and Rubinius (1.8 and 1.9 mode).
